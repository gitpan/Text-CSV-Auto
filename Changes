Revision history for Perl extension Text::CSV::Auto.

0.06      2011-03-08
 - Support a "data_type" key in the analyze() results.  Needed for
   ExportTo::MySQL to create the table definition.

0.05      2011-03-07
 - Build out framework for exporters.
 - Created CSV exporter as a proof-of-concept.
 - Support plugins in Text::CSV::Auto::Plugin.

0.04      2011-03-07
 - More documentation cleanup.
 - Rearrange the headers behavior so that when headers are pulled from the
   CSV they can be gotten at via the headers attribute.

0.03      2011-03-06
 - Provide an OO interface, with a lightweight functional interface on top
   of it.
 - Documented some of the TODOs.
 - Fix testing prerequisites.
 - Made documentation in analyze a little more presentable.
 - Rename the "undef" data type to "empty".  Yes, not backwards
   compatible, but I doubt anyone is using this module yet.

 - Tests.
 - Fix row count when the header is being pulled from the first row.
 - Many typo fixes in the documentation.
